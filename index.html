With our Revit integration, it is able to export Revit 3D models, plans, views to Virtual Reality in one-click. Supported by our cloud services, remote Virtual Reality tour becomes really easier than before.

Supported by our cloud services, remote Virtual Reality tour becomes really easier than before. Taking the advantages of multiuser, visualization, inspection and discussion become possible in Virtual Reality.</p>
					<p>We found out multiuser is useful and important in a Virtual Reality guided tour. We tried IrisVR, Enscape and other VR solution, and it shows single user VR is very hard for an end-user meeting presentation and coordination meeting discussion. Instead, VRcollab provides a way for the host to show a guided tour and a presentation in Vritual Reality, and also let different disciplines to be in the same environment so that everyone can understand and be in the same page with each others.</p>
					<p>Multiuser Virtual reality is best experienced in person! <a href="#contact">It is FREE to request a demo from VRcollab team.</a></p>
