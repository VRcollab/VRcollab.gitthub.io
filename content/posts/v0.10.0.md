In version v0.10.0, we have completely reiterated the design of the launcher, with a more focused workflow centred around stakeholder collaboration and data communication.

Also introducing multi-language support, starting with our Mandarin Language support, with many other languages coming in the next few months.


##  Multiuser Internet Coordination

### Mini-map, Gridlines and Section Box

With the development of this version, we have concentrated on features that allow the user to better appreciate and communicate the wealth of spatial data that is in the BIM design. A couple of key upgrades we would like to highlight are:
\
\
\
**Mini-Map**

A Plan View Mini-map allows the user to orientate themselves when moving through the model in real time. The Mini-map is accessible through the views panel, and will be positioned along with the model views that was exported along with the BIM.

\
\
\
**Gridlines**

Gridlines are now available for Revit exports, enabling the user to quickly check the coordinates of certain issues. This information will also be exported in the next version when users annotate and generate the coordination report.

\
\
\
**Section Box**

An upgrade to the cutting plane with a 6 sided section box, which allows the user to define exactly not only the dimensions but also the degree of the cutting planes. A orange highlight also is visible of the cut out sections.
