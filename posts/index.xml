      <description>With the growing adoption of BIM (Building Information Modelling) in the last decade, construction methodologies have seen an evolution towards lean construction and integrated project delivery. This entails the need for collaborative software, digitalisation of information, along with new organisational space approaches that are in tune to the Virtual Design Construction (VDC) framework.
 #1: Co-located BIG Room As construction projects grow increasingly more complex, in both scale and technical specifications.</description>

      <description>Building design coordination has traditionally been done in both meeting and board rooms, usually in front of a large screen while stakeholder’s perspective are dictated by a single pilot.
