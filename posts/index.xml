      <description>In version v0.10.0, we have completely reiterated the design of the launcher, with a more focused workflow centred around stakeholder collaboration and data communication.
Does your VRcollab Launcher look different? Don&amp;rsquo;t fret!
Also introducing multi-language support, starting with our Mandarin Language support, with many other languages coming in the next few months.
Multiuser Internet Coordination One key feature we are proud of is the ease at which the new launcher enables users to host or join coordination meetings with stakeholders from around the world in a couple of easy steps:</description>

      <description>With the growing adoption of BIM (Building Information Modelling) in the last decade, construction methodologies have seen an evolution towards lean construction and integrated project delivery. This entails the need for collaborative software, digitalisation of information, along with new organisational space approaches that are in tune to the Virtual Design Construction (VDC) framework.
 #1: Co-located BIG Room As construction projects grow increasingly more complex, in both scale and technical specifications.</description>

      <description>Building design coordination has traditionally been done in both meeting and board rooms, usually in front of a large screen while stakeholder’s perspective are dictated by a single pilot. Navigating BIM software to the best possible perspective in order to coordinate both clashes and design.
This tedious process is further complicated by another two professionals whose role is to capture the projected screen and annotate important considerations. All this is then finally consolidated for further interrogation and remodelling.</description>

      <description>Introduction Architecture, Engineering &amp;amp; Construction projects have long been hamstrung by delays and escalating costs due to a myriad of unforeseen factors and events during the planning and execution of complex projects. While economic risks can never be entirely mitigated, the advent of new technology has always been a key driver for change.
Why is the AEC industry adopting Virtual Reality? Over the past two decades, progress within the AEC industry has largely been the result of a few technological shifts that have transformed the way in which buildings are fundamentally conceived, designed and built.</description>
